Taks3, Using OpenSSL from the command line interface

Now, our goal is to create a text file that can be encrypted in three different types. For this, I have to create a directory for this project and access this directory. So, I used my terminal and went to my desire folder, and type

```
mkdir Project 2 – openssl
cd Project 2 - openssl
```

Then for the text file created, we used nano editor and named as “textFile”

```
nano textFile
```

Here we typed our text, “Hi everyone, This is a group project about OpenSSL. Our goal is to encrypt and decrypt using OpenSSL.”
Then press ctrl + X, then y, and press enter to save this text.
